# Wear-AI
📌 Project Overview

WearAI is an AI-powered virtual outfit try-on system that allows users to visualize how clothes would fit them without physically wearing them. Using Augmented Reality (AR), AI-based body detection, and 3D rendering, WearAI overlays selected outfits onto the user's body in real-time, helping them make confident shopping decisions.

It works just like Lenskart’s virtual glasses try-on but for clothes! Users can scan their body, select an outfit, and see how it looks on them instantly.
✨ Key Features

✅ Real-Time Virtual Try-On

- Uses AI-powered body scanning and AR to overlay clothes on the user.
- Works with both live camera feed & pre-captured images.

✅ Body Measurement & Fit Estimation

- Detects height, weight, and body shape from a simple scan.
- Suggests best-fitting sizes automatically.

✅ 3D Clothing Simulation & Fabric Rendering

- Displays realistic fabric movement (tight fit, loose fit, stretch).
- Adjusts based on user’s pose & lighting conditions.

✅ E-Commerce & Brand Integration

- Can be integrated with fashion websites (Amazon, Myntra, Ajio, etc.).
- Users can buy clothes directly after trying them.

✅ AI-Powered Outfit Recommendations

- Suggests outfits based on user’s style & body type.
- Uses machine learning to recommend trending looks.

✅ Social Media Sharing & Feedback

- Users can share try-on images with friends for feedback.
- Integration with Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok.
