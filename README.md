# Wear-AI
WearAI is an AI-powered virtual outfit try-on system that allows users to visualize how clothes would fit them without physically wearing them. Using Augmented Reality (AR), AI-based body detection, and 3D rendering, WearAI overlays selected outfits onto the user's body in real-time, helping them make confident shopping decisions.
